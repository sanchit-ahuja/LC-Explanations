## Find Single Number 2

Give an array of nums, all numbers repeat twice except 2 nos, find those nos. \
```Input:  [1,2,1,3,2,5] ``` \
    ``` Output: [3,5] ```

1. First we need to xor out all the nos. We accumulate the xor of the two nos we need to find.
2. Now, we observe that the set bits in the accumulated variable implies that the bit differs at those positions.This means that the bit at those positions are either 1 or 0 or vice-versa. We need to find the position of that bit.
3. To find the position of that bit, we use this --> ```mask = xor &(~xor + 1) ``` . Let's say our xor is ```XOR = aaaa1000(a = 1 or 0)```. First ```~XOR = bbbb0111 (b = ~a)```. Add 1 with carrying bits, ```~XOR + 1 = bbbb1000```. Then &, ```XOR & (~XOR + 1) = 00001000```
4. We get the set position. Now divide all the nos in the array into the 2 groups with either this position bit as set or unset. We xor the groups individually and get our nos.

```c++

    vector<int> singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        int mask = 0;
        for(int x : nums) {
            mask ^= x;
        }
        mask = mask&(~mask+1); //The most crucial step to get our set bit
        int num1 = 0,num2 = 0;
        for(int x : nums) {
            if((x&mask) == 0) {
                num1^=x;
            }
            else {
                num2^=x;
            }
        }
        return {num1,num2};
    }

```
