## Ugly Number 3
Write a program to find the n-th ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive integers which are divisible by a or b or c.

``` txt
Input: n = 3, a = 2, b = 3, c = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10... The 3rd is 4.

Ideas
1. I earlier thought it to be similar problem to the ugly number 2 which involved getting the nth ugly number whose prime factors only included 2,3,5. This question is basically merging 3 sorted arrays. But this question is asking us to find the nth number that is divisible by a **or** b **or** c.
2. The above statement gives us the idea to use set theory (Princple of inclusion-exclusion) i.e. aUbUc = a+b+c -ab-bc-ca +abc. Since we need the number that is divisible by either a or b or c. aUbUc = N/a + N/b + N/c - N/lcm(a,b) - N/lcm(b,c) - N/lcm(c,a) + N/lcm(a,bc). LCM because that is the least common multiple of the two numbers and N/lcm gives the numbers that divide both a or b. 
3. Then we can use binary search on the above function to find the value of N. Since the function is monotonic.

```c++
    long lcm(long a, long b) {
        return (a*b)/__gcd(a,b);
    }
    bool func(long mid, int n, int a, int b, int c) {
        long temp = lcm(b,c);
        long f = mid/a + mid/b + mid/c - mid/lcm(a,b) - mid/lcm(a,c) - mid/lcm(b,c) + mid/lcm(a,temp);
        // cout<<f<<endl;
        return f>=n;
    }
    int nthUglyNumber(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
        long lo = 0, hi = 2*1e+9;
        long ans = 0;
        while(lo<=hi) {
            long mid = lo +(hi-lo)/2;
            if(func(mid,n,a,b,c)) {
                ans = mid;
                hi = mid-1;
            }
            else {
                lo = mid+1;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
