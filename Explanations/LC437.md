# Path sum III

You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.

Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards (traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes).

**Example** \
`root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8`

``` text
      10
     /  \
    5   -3
   / \    \
  3   2   11
 / \   \
3  -2   1

Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:

1.  5 -> 3
2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
3. -3 -> 11
```

1. One approach is O(n^2). That is for every node try to get the sum = k.
2. There's another approach which employs the usage of prefix sum. (Similar to subarray sum equal to k)
3. Maintain a map of tracking all the paths with sum = k. If we encounter the sum again, we don't need to traverse it again.

```c++
    int solve(TreeNode* root, int sum, unordered_map<int,int>&umap, int target) {
        if(root == NULL) {
            return 0;
        }
        sum+= root->val;
        int ans = 0;
        if(umap.count(sum - target)) {
            ans += umap[sum-target]; //Similar to the subarray sum = k
        }
        umap[sum]+=1; //Add the current path
        ans += solve(root->left,sum,umap,target) + solve(root->right,sum,umap,target); //go into recursion
        umap[sum]-=1; //When out of the recursion remove the current path
        return ans;
    }
    int pathSum(TreeNode* root, int sum) {
        unordered_map<int,int>umap;
        umap[0] = 1;
        return solve(root,0,umap,sum);

    }

```
