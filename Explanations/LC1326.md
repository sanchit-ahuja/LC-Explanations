## Minimum Number of taps to open to water a garden

There is a one-dimensional garden on the x-axis. The garden starts at the point 0 and ends at the point n. (i.e The length of the garden is n).

There are ```n + 1``` taps located at points ```[0, 1, ..., n]``` in the garden.

Given an integer n and an integer array ranges of length n + 1 where ranges[i] (0-indexed) means the i-th tap can water the area ```[i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]]``` if it was open.

Return the minimum number of taps that should be open to water the whole garden, If the garden cannot be watered return -1.

```Input: n = 5, ranges = [3,4,1,1,0,0]```\
```Output: 1```

### Approach 1
There are couple of ways to do this problem. First one is using the Jump Game II solution to go ahead.
* Notice that the minimum the tap can water for a certain idx i is max(0,i-ranges[i]) and max is min(n,i+ranges[i])
* We can think of this range as jump starting from idx max(0,i-ranges[i]) with max reach till the above interval difference i.e. ```max(0,i-ranges[i]) and max is min(n,i+ranges[i])```
* Now we just need to calculate the minimum amount of jumps needed to get till the end
* If the stairs are negative, then it's not possible to reach till the end

``` c++

     int minTaps(int n, vector<int>& ranges) {
        vector<int>jumps(n+1,0);
        for(int i = 0;i<ranges.size();i++) {
            int l = max(0,i-ranges[i]);
            int r = min(n,i+ranges[i]);
            jumps[l] = max(jumps[l],r-l);
        }
        //Normal Jump game II logic
        int stairs = jumps[0];
        int ladder_size = jumps[0];
        int jump = 1;
        for(int i = 1;i<jumps.size();i++) {
            if(i == jumps.size()-1) {
                return stairs<0?-1:jump;
            }
            if(i+jumps[i]>ladder_size) {
                ladder_size = i+jumps[i];
            }
            stairs--;
            if(stairs == 0) {
                jump++;
                stairs = ladder_size-i;
            }
        }
        cout<<stairs<<endl;
        return jump;
        // return jumps>n?-1:jumps;
    }

```
