# Set Intersection Size At Least Two

An integer interval [a, b] (for integers a < b) is a set of all consecutive integers from a to b, including a and b.

Find the minimum size of a set S such that for every integer interval A in intervals, the intersection of S with A has size at least 2.

```text
Input: intervals = [[1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 5]]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Consider the set S = {2, 3, 4}.  For each interval, there are at least 2 elements from S in the interval.
Also, there isn't a smaller size set that fulfills the above condition.
Thus, we output the size of this set, which is 3.
```

This is a difficult problem.

1. Greedy based approach works here. There will be 3 cases to take care off in this problem. Assume we have a set that is at least of size 2. We will only be considering largest and second largest element of that set.

2. Case 1 is when both largest and second largest are inside the interval, intervals[i]. Then we don't need to do anything.

3. Case 2 is when the largest one is not inside the interval, so we can get it inside the interval by reducing it's size and adding 1 to the size of our set.

4. Case 3 is when both are not inside the interval, both can be reduced in size and 2 be added to the answer to maintain the set.

```c++
int intersectionSizeTwo(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        int largest = -1, second = -1, cnt = 0;
        sort(intervals.begin(),intervals.end(),[](vector<int>v1,vector<int>v2) {
            if(v1[1] == v2[1]) {
                return v1[0]>v2[0];
            }
            return v1[1]<v2[1];
        });
        for(auto v : intervals) {
            int a = v[0], b = v[1];
            bool large = a<=largest;
            bool sec = a<=second;
            if(large && sec) {
                continue;
            }
            cnt += (large?1:2);
            second = large ? largest : b-1;
            largest = b;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
```
