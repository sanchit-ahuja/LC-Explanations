### Longest Consecutive Sequence

Tell the length of the consecutive sequence in an unsorted array. Numbers should be unique.

``` Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]  Output: 4  Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4. ```

1. One way is to sort the array and check it out. O(nlgn) 
2. Another way is to use a set. Build the sequence. Check the comments in the code below

```c++
      int longestConsecutive(vector<int>& nums) {
        int ans = 0;
        set<int>s(nums.begin(),nums.end());
        //Build the sequence
        for(int num : s) {
            if(!s.count(num-1)) { //if the number previous to the current num doesn't exist, we can start the sequence building from the current number
                int curr_len = 1; //Current len of the sequence
                int curr_num = num; //current number
                while(s.count(curr_num+1)) { //if the next number in the sequence is in the set, build the sequence
                    curr_len +=1; //increment the the cur_len
                    curr_num += 1; // increment the cur_num
                }
                ans = max(curr_len,ans); //ans until now.
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }

```
